      <p className="my-4">
        Every day, either on social media or on Television, you are hearing
        about women being victimized. There are so many stories of women that
        are available and you can hear about sexual violence or a random attack
        by strangers as well as being abused in some way. The world is changing
        and becoming more unpredictable particularly for women. As such,
        self-defence training is one of the most needed and must for every
        woman's to-do list. In the crime world, self-defence training is
        suggested, so that the women can resist any kind of sexual assault as
        well as random attacks. Here are the reasons why self-defence is so
        important for women.{" "}

        Reasons for joining the self-defence Training Program

      <p className="my-4">
        Still, now, women are not able to get equal rights in society. They are
        restricted to do their responsibilities. People should come out from
        these restrictions and limitations and motivate them by presenting gifts
        for women. The women are failed to protect themselves when they are
        facing any kind of sexual violence and random attack. The main reason
        for the failure is fear. The below mentioned are the reasons for joining
        the self-defence training program and usage of self-defence weapons.

        The world will cause violence not only for adult women but also for
        young girls and children. The girl can join the course when she enters
        into her 11 age. Before joining the course, she should have physical
        fitness and a disciplined mindset. In most cases, the height of the girl
        is playing an important role in the eligibility criteria of the
        self-defence training. The girl should be at least 36 inches tall to
        start and join in the self-defence training. But an adult can join and
        learn a self-defence program at any time if they are physically fit.

        Offer a High Confidence Level
      </h1>
      <p className="my-4">
        Self-defence is offering so many benefits to women, but particularly it
        is improving the confidence level in women. Many people think
        self-defence courses are providing physical benefits to women. But in
        fact, the course is training the mental health of the woman. For
        instance, if you are a college student, you will go to the classes with
        the fear of men harassing and bothering you. Generally, whenever the
        women are put in any hassle conditions, the fear will refuse them to
        fight against the men. So instead of being scared, you can find a
        comfortable life with the help of self-defence. The woman who can defend
        herself against a potential criminal will have a high level of
        self-confidence. The mother, a working woman, a student, and younger
        ladies can gain confidence from a self-defence course.
