          Violence against women – particularly intimate partner violence and
          sexual violence – is a major public health problem and a violation of
          women's human rights.
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Estimates published by WHO indicate that globally about 1 in 3 (30%)
          of women worldwide have been subjected to either physical and/or
          sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in
          their lifetime.
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost
          one third (27%) of women aged 15-49 years who have been in a
          relationship report that they have been subjected to some form of
          physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner.
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual, and
          reproductive health, and may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in
          some settings.
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Violence against women is preventable. The health sector has an
          important role to play to provide comprehensive health care to women
          subjected to violence, and as an entry point for referring women to
          other support services they may need.

        Overview
      </h3>

      <p className="my-4">
        The United Nations defines violence against women as "any act of
        gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in,
        physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women, including
        threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty,
        whether occurring in public or in private life" (1). <br />
        <p className="font-semibold">Intimate partner violence</p> refers to
        behaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical,
        sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual
        coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours. Sexual
        violence is "any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or other
        act directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person
        regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It
        includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced
        penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or
        object, attempted rape, unwanted sexual touching and other non-contact
        forms."

        Scope of the problem
      </h3>
      <p className="my-4">
        Population-level surveys based on reports from survivors provide the
        most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence
        and sexual violence. A 2018 analysis of prevalence data from 2000–2018
        across 161 countries and areas, conducted by WHO on behalf of the UN
        Interagency working group on violence against women, found that
        worldwide, nearly 1 in 3, or 30%, of women have been subjected to
        physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner or non-partner
        sexual violence or both (2).

            Global and regional estimates of violence against women
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="my-4">
        Over a quarter of women aged 15–49 years who have been in a relationship
        have been subjected to physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate
        partner at least once in their lifetime (since age 15). The prevalence
        estimates of lifetime intimate partner violence range from 20% in the
        Western Pacific, 22% in high-income countries and Europe and 25% in the
        WHO Regions of the Americas to 33% in the WHO African region, 31% in the
        WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, and 33% in the WHO South-East Asia
        region. Globally as many as 38% of all murders of women are committed by
        intimate partners. In addition to intimate partner violence, globally 6%
        of women report having been sexually assaulted by someone other than a
        partner, although data for non-partner sexual violence are more limited.
        Intimate partner and sexual violence are mostly perpetrated by men
        against women. Lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and its social and
        economic impacts have increased the exposure of women to abusive
        partners and known risk factors, while limiting their access to
        services. Situations of humanitarian crises and displacement may
        exacerbate existing violence, such as by intimate partners, as well as
        non-partner sexual violence, and may also lead to new forms of violence
        against women.

        Factors associated with intimate partner violence and sexual violence
        against women
      </h3>
      <p className="my-4">
        Intimate partner and sexual violence is the result of factors occurring
        at individual, family, community and wider society levels that interact
        with each other to increase or reduce risk (protective). Some are
        associated with being a perpetrator of violence, some are associated
        with experiencing violence and some are associated with both.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Risk factors for both intimate partner and sexual violence include:
      </p>
      <ul className=" list-disc font-semibold mx-10 ">
        <li className=" my-2">
          lower levels of education (perpetration of sexual violence and
          experience of sexual violence);

        <li className=" my-2">
          a history of exposure to child maltreatment (perpetration and
          experience);
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          witnessing family violence (perpetration and experience);

          harmful use of alcohol (perpetration and experience);
        </li>

        <li className=" my-2">
          harmful masculine behaviours, including having multiple partners or
          attitudes that condone violence (perpetration);
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          community norms that privilege or ascribe higher status to men and
          lower status to women;

        Health consequences
      </h3>
      <p className="my-4">
        Intimate partner (physical, sexual and psychological) and sexual
        violence cause serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and
        reproductive health problems for women. They also affect their
        children’s health and well-being. This violence leads to high social and
        economic costs for women, their families and societies. Such violence
        can:
      </p>
      <ul className=" list-disc font-semibold mx-10 ">
        <li className=" my-2">Have fatal outcomes like homicide or suicide.</li>

        <li className=" my-2">
          Lead to injuries, with 42% of women who experience intimate partner
          violence reporting an injury as a consequence of this violence (3).
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Lead to unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, gynaecological
          problems, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. WHO's
          2013 study on the health burden associated with violence against women
          found that women who had been physically or sexually abused were 1.5
          times more likely to have a sexually transmitted infection and, in
          some regions, HIV, compared to women who had not experienced partner
          violence. They are also twice as likely to have an abortion (3).
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Intimate partner violence in pregnancy also increases the likelihood
          of miscarriage, stillbirth, pre-term delivery and low birth weight
          babies. The same 2013 study showed that women who experienced intimate
          partner violence were 16% more likely to suffer a miscarriage and 41%
          more likely to have a pre-term birth (3).
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          These forms of violence can lead to depression, post-traumatic stress
          and other anxiety disorders, sleep difficulties, eating disorders, and
          suicide attempts. The 2013 analysis found that women who have
          experienced intimate partner violence were almost twice as likely to
          experience depression and problem drinking.
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Health effects can also include headaches, pain syndromes (back pain,
          abdominal pain, chronic pelvic pain) gastrointestinal disorders,
          limited mobility and poor overall health.
        </li>
        <li className=" my-2">
          Sexual violence, particularly during childhood, can lead to increased
          smoking, substance use, and risky sexual behaviours. It is also
          associated with perpetration of violence (for males) and being a
          victim of violence (for females).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-left font-semibold text-[28px] mb-3 mt-6">
        Impact on children
      </h3>
      <ul className=" list-disc font-semibold mx-10 ">
        <li className=" my-2">
          Children who grow up in families where there is violence may suffer a
          range of behavioural and emotional disturbances. These can also be
          associated with perpetrating or experiencing violence later in life.
        </li>

        <li className=" my-2">
          Intimate partner violence has also been associated with higher rates
          of infant and child mortality and morbidity (through, for example
          diarrhoeal disease or malnutrition and lower immunization rates).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-left font-semibold text-[28px] mb-3 mt-6">
        Social and economic costs
      </h3>
      <p className="my-4">
        The social and economic costs of intimate partner and sexual violence
        are enormous and have ripple effects throughout society. Women may
        suffer isolation, inability to work, loss of wages, lack of
        participation in regular activities and limited ability to care for
        themselves and their children.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-left font-semibold text-[28px] mb-3 mt-6">
        Prevention and response
      </h3>
      <p className="my-4">
        There is growing evidence on what works to prevent violence against
        women, based on well-designed evaluations. In 2019, WHO and UN Women
        with endorsement from 12 other UN and bilateral agencies published
        RESPECT women – a framework for preventing violence against women aimed
        at policy makers. Each letter of RESPECT stands for one of seven
        strategies: Relationship skills strengthening; Empowerment of women;
        Services ensured; Poverty reduced; Enabling environments (schools, work
        places, public spaces) created; Child and adolescent abuse prevented;
        and Transformed attitudes, beliefs and norms. For each of these seven
        strategies there are a range of interventions in low and high resource
        settings with varying degree of evidence of effectiveness. Examples of
        promising interventions include psychosocial support and psychological
        interventions for survivors of intimate partner violence; combined
        economic and social empowerment programmes; cash transfers; working with
        couples to improve communication and relationship skills; community
        mobilization interventions to change unequal gender norms; school
        programmes that enhance safety in schools and reduce/eliminate harsh
        punishment and include curricula that challenges gender stereotypes and
        promotes relationships based on equality and consent; and group-based
        participatory education with women and men to generate critical
        reflections about unequal gender power relationships. RESPECT also
        highlights that successful interventions are those that prioritize
        safety of women; whose core elements involve challenging unequal gender
        power relationships; that are participatory; address multiple risk
        factors through combined programming and that start early in the life
        course. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact and enforce
        legislation and develop and implement policies that promote gender
        equality; allocate resources to prevention and response; and invest in
        women’s rights organizations.
