        Violence against women is a serious and widespread issue in Australia,
        as well as throughout the world. And while the long term goal is
        education to stop violence against women, there are actionable
        strategies women can employ, right now. Here are 7 very simple reasons
        you should consider taking a women’s self defense class.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 font-semibold text-[21px] ">
        1 – Don’t Become a Statistic
      </p>
      <div className="flex flex-row items-center justify-center">
        <img src={"/assets/img-3.png"} className=" w-[650px] h-[600px] " />
      </div>
      <p className="my-4">
        Frankly, the statistics in Australia alone are frightening. At least one
        woman a week is killed by a partner or former partner. One in three
        women have experienced physical violence. 300,000 women a year
        experience physical or sexual violence from a stranger. Violence against
        women contributes to more death, disability and illness to women between
        15 and 44 than any other preventable risk factor. Learning self-defense
        gives you the power to avoid becoming one of these statistics, now.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 font-semibold text-[21px] ">
        2 – Prevention and Awareness
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        As teens and adults we become increasingly fixated on the front and our
        devices, often being unaware of what’s around us. You work with an
        experienced instructor to develop strategies that work best for you
        against a variety of opponents, attacks and situations. Above all,
        women’s self defense teaches us awareness and prevention.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 font-semibold text-[21px] ">
        3 – Take Control for Yourself and Other Women
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Women’s self defense is about taking safety into our own hands. Taking a

      <div className="flex flex-row items-center justify-center">
        <img src={"/assets/img-4.png"} className=" w-[500px] h-[400px] " />
      </div>
      <p className="my-4">
        Self defense class is our chance to take action in our own lives, to
        take control of our own present and future. The fact is, crimes against
        women happen and will continue to happen. Women’s self defense classes
        can help prevent us becoming victims. Knowing how to defend ourselves
        gives us a better chance of stopping attacks and even lessening attacks
        against women in the future.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 font-semibold text-[21px] ">4 – Great Exercise!</p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Self defense classes, at the end of the day, can also be a great source
        of exercise, working a range of vital parts of your body. It not only
        exercises your body physically, it also exercises your mind, reactions
        and reflexes. It is also an incredible way of exercising your own power
        and confidence. You do not have to be physically strong to be successful
        at self-defense. If you can learn to successfully escape or prevent a
        dangerous situation, then you are exercising good self-defense.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 font-semibold text-[21px] ">5 – Be Accountable</p>
      <p className="my-4">
        As women, we are constantly encouraged to be accountable for ourselves.
        We are told to be accountable for our finances. We are told to account
        for our stress and encouraged to be accountable for our health, weight
        and diet, along with our workouts and fitness. It stands to reason that
        we should be accountable for our self defense. Is it really so hard to
        add a self defense class to our routine as we would add the latest yoga,
        pilates or work out fad? However, unlike a fad, this is something that
        will actually make a monumental, positive change to our lives.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 font-semibold text-[21px] ">6 – Be Feminine</p>
      <p className="my-4">
        There is a terrible misconception – unfortunately perpetuated by mass
        media – that self defense is unfeminine and unattractive. These
        dangerous articles claim that women who pursue self defense are
        masculine, “jacked up” and have a distasteful love for violence.
        However, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, many models,
        actresses and even pageant winners are devotees of women’s self defense.
        Women’s self defense is incredibly feminine because it is empowering.
        Encouraging women to take self defense is a beautiful, inspiring thing.
        So, ignore the dangerous misconceptions of mainstream media and enjoy
        learning self defense.

      <p className="my-4 font-semibold text-[21px] ">7 – Do Something Now</p>

      <p className="my-4">
        Of course we need better education to end violence against women and
        men. Violence of all kinds is unacceptable. Unfortunately, though,
        education is long term and may not be able to help you today, tomorrow
        or even next year. That is why women’s self defense education is
        important. This is something that can happen now. Women’s self defense
        provides functional strategies, techniques and training methods to stop
        an attacker intent on hurting you. It gives you the security and
        confidence, right now, that you can protect yourself should the need
        arise. Unfortunately, no matter how well intended, ideologies can’t do
        that. So until education catches up with reality, keep yourselves safe.

        our women’s self defense classes and courses. We can also provide
