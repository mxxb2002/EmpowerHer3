        Helping women and girls to feel safe and be safe
      </h1>
      <p className="my-4">
        In December 2021 the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) published
        Year 1 of a three-year national framework setting out their approach to
        policing violence against women and girls. We welcomed and fully support
        the national framework. Violence against women and girls continues to
        take place and the harm caused to all survivors, their families and
        society is significant. North Yorkshire Police has already adopted
        'violence against women and girls' as a strategic priority and
        recognised misogyny as a hate crime. We have a raft of initiatives,
        internal and external, which demonstrate our commitment to develop our
        staff and to investigate, bring offenders to justice and safeguard
        victims. We know that we need to do more to eliminate violence against
        women and girls. To remove the harm that blights our society. We have
        the power, responsibility and opportunity to prevent and to reduce harm.
        Through this strategy we set out our approach to ensuring every woman
        and girl in North Yorkshire feels safe and is safe. We are restating our
        commitment to delivering against he areas of focus set out by the NPCC
        and how we will go further to demonstrate that 'We care'. Eliminating
        violence against women and girls will require a collaborative solution
        because it is a societal problem. We are committed to making the
        difference that the public, especially women and girls, and our
        partners, expect from us as their police service.

          Police. Definition of Violence against Women and Girls, July 2021, HM
          Government: The term ‘violence against women and girls’ refers to acts
          of violence or abuse that we know disproportionately affect women and
          girls. Crimes and behaviour covered by this term include rape and
          other sexual offences, domestic abuse, stalking, ‘honour’-based abuse
          (including female genital mutilation forced marriage, and ‘honour’
          killings), as well as many others, including offences committed
          online. While we use the term ‘violence against women and girls’,
          throughout this Strategy, this refers to all victims of any of these
          offences.
