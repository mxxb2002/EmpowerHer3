        The clocks have gone back, the evenings are drawing in, the weather is
        changing. None of this makes it easier for people to exercise. For many,
        the winter nights can be a threat to mental wellbeing. People like me
        (men) have historically dealt with these winter fears by ignoring them.
        Active men like me love telling anyone who will listen how good exercise
        is for physical and mental health. And when my wife hasn’t immediately
        rushed out of the house to jog around the block in the dark and gloom,
        I’ve just repeated the message, but louder. But it was on an autumn
        evening, while walking along the Wirral Way with my wife Sally, that I
        learned what the real barrier was to her going out and exercising in the
        winter. She listed to me all the things that would stop her, as a woman,
        using the former railway line we were strolling along to exercise after
        dark. Her fears, it turned out, were all to do with the behaviour of the
        half of the population who are men. Her barrier to exercise was people
        like me. One in every five women is concerned about sexual harassment
        when exercising – and three in 10 have experienced it first-hand, while
        doing physical activity, mostly in streets and parks. And we know that
        people will not do something – whether that’s walking or cycling to
        school, or jogging before work – if they do not feel safe doing so.

        think very differently about the safety of my two daughters compared to
        that of my sons; I don’t expect my boys to hold their keys in their hand
        and text when they get to their destination. I don’t feel the need to
        advise them not to stay out too late or to walk home with a friend. As
        my wife listed all the reasons she wouldn’t jog on the Wirral Way that
        night, I realised I’d put the burden of responsibility of keeping safe
        on my 17-year-old daughter, rather than focusing on removing the reason
        for her – and my – anxiety. As men, we can play a big part in reducing
        the stress that women shoulder. Of course, I know that most of the men
        reading this aren’t the aggressors and that they would never harass a
        woman, but the point is that women do not know that.

        campaign has set out some steps for men, to guide them on how to make
        women feel safer when they are getting active outdoors this autumn and
        winter. First, keep your distance: the closer you are, the more
        threatening you seem. If you’re walking or running behind a woman, pause
        to give her some space, or cross the road so you aren’t behind her any
        more. Understand that women’s wariness and suspicion is not personal, so
        don’t be offended. Women have no way of knowing you are not a threat.
        Never make comments, even if you think it’s a compliment. It’s
        intimidating to a woman on her own. Stay quiet. If you see friends or
        family members making disrespectful comments to a woman, challenge them
        and explain why it’s not OK. We need to break the cycle of misogyny that
        contributes to women feeling unsafe. Show younger men what it looks like
        to listen to women. Talk to them about what harassment is. Help them
        understand why a comment they think is harmless may terrorise a woman.
        If you notice a woman being harassed, show your support – it can be as
        simple as standing between her and the harasser. Finally, share these
        tips with all the men you know. The more we educate men, the safer women
        will feel. Nothing I have written above is onerous or difficult. We can
        all play our part in ensuring the future world is safer for women – the
        potential gains are enormous and the cost of achieving them is so low.
