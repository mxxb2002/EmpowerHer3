        Violence Against Women and Girls

      <p className="my-4">
        The harm caused to victims and society by violence against women and
        girls (VAWG) in all its forms – including but not limited to harassment,
        stalking, rape, sexual assault, murder, honour-based abuse, coercive
        control – is immeasurable. While men and boys also suffer from many of
        these forms of abuse, they disproportionately affect women. A woman is
        killed by a man{" "}

        . Policing, and society, must focus on violence against women and girls
        so that it can be eradicated. The policing response has been shown to be
        inconsistent and so there is now a national focus on supporting forces
        to prioritise VAWG-related crimes. What are we doing? In December 2021,
        the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and{" "}

          College of Policing.
        </a>
        published a new police VAWG framework, developed under the leadership of
        the National Police Lead for VAWG Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth,
        and informed by experts in policing, government and the VAWG sector.

        aims to support police forces to better understand the influences and
        levers that contribute to VAWG. Forces will use the STRA to effectively
        target their finite resources and decide how many officers will be
        needed to tackle the rising rates of violent and sexual crimes faced by
        women. It will also be used to identifying where they should focus
        specialist investigators, victim support and crime-fighting technology
        to tackle the problem. Nearly all forms of VAWG are expected to continue
        to rise in the coming year. The offences identified in the STRA as
        carrying the biggest threat to women are:
