        Protecting oneself from potential assault by using defensive strategies
        is called self-protection. Self-defense training teaches women effective
        physical and verbal skills to cope with the assault situation. The study
        was conducted in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The main objective of the
        research was a comparison of the strategies which self-defense trained
        and untrained girls used to attempt for their self-protection in order
        to reduce the risk of violence. The study finds out the effectiveness of
        self-defense training towards women’s self-protection. Non random

      <p className="mt-4 font-semibold text-[18px] mb-[-10px] ">INTRODUCTION</p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Every woman around the globe has self-defense and personal protection
        concern because of violence against women, both corporeal and intimate
        which is an institutional setback that remains embedded in our society
        which needs attention at both personal and community level (Weitlauf. et
        al., 2000). Now women are deliberately refusing to the mistreatment and
        aggression from their families, husband, boyfriends, strangers
        (Schneider and Jordan, 1978). For these motives, women learn diverse
        assault avoidance programs such as carrying weapons, executing crime
        prevention strategies and self-defense skills. Women experience more of
        violence than those of men. Hollander (2010) observed in her study that
        75% students had experienced about an intimate victimization, violence,
        and an oppression while ten percent confide any prior physical
        victimization due to their enrollment in self-defense classes. Brecklin
        (2004) stated that women are more likely to involve in self-protection
        strategies due to their experiences of the different form of violence
        and oppression in both childhood and adult intimate, physical and
        emotional violence and tyranny. Violence residues different
        psychological and physical effects on women’s lives. In order to avoid
        being victimized, women should learn to limit their mobility and depend
        upon their men, burglar alarms, chemical sprays, guard dogs as well as
        other external agents for self-shield. In addition, other challenges are
        providing trainings to avoid danger and encourage change spectator
        interference or social norms (Hollander, 2014). The main target of
        self-defense training programs is to educate women on how to resist
        efficiently if confront with a latent assault. However, it does not
        impart girls how to fight but inculcate them how to defend themselves
        when needed. Self-defense training offers women an entrance to a new set
        of combative responses in assorted assault states. It trains women both
        physically and spiritually for potential attacks (Follansbee, 1982 as
        cited in Brecklin & Ullman, 2005) by providing them with opportunities
        to learn social and cognitive skills through the use of role-plays,
        conversation and simulation of exercises (Peretz, 1991; Thompson, 1991
        as cited in Brecklin & Ullman, 2005 and Cummings, 1992). Self-defense
        training is very significant for women because it pact with three main
        issues of women survival, for example the fear of sexual assault and
        violence, the gender, and the selfhood (Hollander, 2004). It holds
        various levels start from white belt to black belt. Numerous girls
        participate in self-defense training classes and may learn distinct
        techniques such as how to cope with assault circumstances, break free of
        the fingers of an assailant, dent the breathing capacity of an
        assailant, displacing the shoulder or elbow of an assailant, free
        oneself when grabbed at the rear and getting strangled or free oneself
        when tackled to the ground (Weitlauf, et al., 2000). Women are often
        idealized as susceptible, submissive and subject to male vicious
        behavior and violence (McCaughey, 1998). Women have overlooked the
        opportunities of taking physical training and participating in athletes
        due to their stereotypical roles. They also have been dispirited from
        learning self-protection strategies because it may not suitable for
        their feminine roles (Schneider & Jordan, 1978). In Pakistan mostly,
        girls feel communal pressure to defend them due to family’s reverence.
        Due to conventional societal beliefs about women and men’s roles,
        habitually they are reinforced by families to avoid physical resistance
        because it can be harmful for being aggressive. In the study of
        Hollander (2009) perception about women self-defense training is that
        male thinks that after getting self-defense training (SDT) they become
        overconfident and they always set to fight with men and the result would
        be imperiled for women. The idea behind that, women are not intelligent,
        smart enough and even do not think prudently. Some women assume that
        self-defense training increases the chances of victim blame, for
        example, women had self-defense training, but if they fail to protect
        herself then everyone blame her for assault. At the same time, there are
        many winning stories of female resistance. In the study of (Cermele,
        2004) some girl’s perception about fighting back is that they can’t
        fight back against men because it just made condition more horrible and
        they can only defend themselves when they have weapons. The alarm of
        being victimize also keep women at home and they don’t walk alone in
        street at night. In the study of (Harris and Miller 2000 as cited in
        Williams & Hebl, 2005) asked from participants to put forward proper
        strategies for men and women who have a fear of becoming assault
        victims. Then outcome showed that most physical strategies comprise
        physical fighting and taking up body building were suggested for men,
        whereas more submissive strategies included carrying a paper spray,
        cellular phone, being escorted and screaming were recommended to women.
        In order to reduce rape victims, woman should avoid going alone on the
        outside, wearing the dress in a proactive manner and franking with
        strangers or male employees at workplace as well as learning defensive
        techniques. Rozee & Koss (2001) state that even though some parts of
        rapes are inescapable we bicker that women could resists against
        possible rapists if they take training on overcoming psychological
        barriers to resistance, diagnosing as early as possible they are facing
        impending rape and giving an expected ladder through which to progress
        from verbal to physical resistance. Violence against women is a very
        serious problem in almost all cities of Pakistan. Pakistani women had
        become a victim of domestic and street violence, murder, acid throwing,
        intimate partner violence, abduction, honor killing, rape, sexual
        harassment, verbal violence, Karokari and other sexual abuse. Nowadays
        media shows horrible stories of crime against women like rape, acid
        burning for the sake of dowry and murder in the name of so called honor.
        Despite being a religious country, many women, young and small girls
        were victims of rape in Pakistan. As commonly, the majority of rapes are
        perpetrated by men whom women know and men suppose that women will be
        acquiescent and don’t be able to hassle back. As stated by Aurat
        Foundation in 2012, maximum cases of sexual assaults were reported in
        Rawalpindi, Sukkur, Karachi, Khairpur, Tando Allah Yar, Badin, Nawab
        Shah, Kashmore, Sanghar and Dadu. At the same time it is somber to note
        that people arduously report for the sexual assaults in Baluchistan,
        KPK, FATA and ICT regions (Annual Report, 2012). Physical violence upon
        women is more likely to befall in the private sphere. Women are becoming
        sufferer due to their intimate partner violence. Thus, women had a great
        scare of sexual abuse, physical violence and they need protection. For
        the empowerment of women, many violence prevention programs were
        developed such as self-defense training. It empowers women to
        effectively resist assault and not confining their mobility (McCaughey,
        1997; Ozer & Bandura, 1990; Rozee & Koss, 2001 as cited in Hollander,
        2014). Although women had made progress in almost all regions of life,
        but they are still at a vulnerable spot at public places. At public
        places women are not sure about when and which activity of man creates
        hindrance and harm to them. In order to demote the chances of their
        victimization they used different strategies to conquer the violence
        included wearing a wedding ring though unwed (Gardner, C. 1990 ), in
        taxi made a fake call to someone and tell them about their arrival and
        information about taxi, wearing a casual dress that doesn’t entice
        others, walking close to a group of people, sitting in a car with male
        employee minimize their dread, wearing a flat shoes aid them, escaping
        when needed, carrying a weapon ( Gun, knife, lights, Distractions,
        personal alarms, handbag). Sometime women use disparate techniques in
        order to decrease risk like when they are strolling alone and carry a
        home key in their hands and act in such a way that their house is near
        to them; they started feeling secure by standing near a convenient
        police officer or near a group of other women are walking along with
        their male partner and other family members (Gardner, 1990). Clay-Warner
        (2002) evaluates the situational effectiveness of protective strategies
        used by women during attempted and completed rape. She also says that
        women are victorious in protecting themselves when aggressor is a
        foreigner rather than someone who knows them included acquaintance,
        family member and friend. She also points out that the use of physical
        force is amid the vital strategies for escaping a possible rape.
        Self-defense training imparts students various physical and verbal
        skills that not only help them to effectively defend themselves but also
        able to assist others. Mostly women choose to employ self-proactive acts
        when an encounter to sexual abuse by running away, screaming, physically
        fighting, etc. with the assailants (Brecklin & Ullman, 2001; Siegel,
        Sorenson, Golding, Burnam, & Stein, 1989 as cited in Clay –Warner 2003).
        Now there are different self-defense programs in all over Pakistani
        cities. The approach is personal safety and risk reduction. For example,
        self-defense for Women in Karachi, Self Defense, Shotokan Karate,
        Kobudo, & Fitness Instructor training for Females in Rawalpindi. There
        is need for change; otherwise Pakistani society will push itself with
        back to dark ages. Men and women should be equal donors of social
        change. The research will help to evaluate how self-defense can help
        women. In this study comparison have been made between the perception of
        both self defense trained and untrained girls towards their self
        protection. And the strategies of both self defense trained and
        untrained girls towards their self protection have been evaluated.

      <p className="my-4">
        The study was conducted in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The Purposive
        Sampling Technique was used to select sample size. The sample of 120
        women was selected to reach the objectives of the study. The sample
        includes both trained and untrained women. Data were collected through
        questionnaires. The schooling levels of respondents were matriculation
        to M. Phil level. The data on self-defense trained girls were collected
        from Shotokan karate international school, Army sports club, GHQ, and
        the data of untrained women was collected from Fatima Jinnah Women
        University. The Age range of participants was from 18 to 28. All
        self-defense trained students having minimum orange belt training and
        above were selected below this belt were excluded. All respondents were
        educated therefore; researcher used English and Urdu language for
        communication. Participants were requested not to omit any questions in
        the questionnaire. The independent t - test is used to compare the
        perceptions of self defense trained and untrained women towards their
        self protection. Along with the t-test, descriptive analysis is used to
        evaluate the strategies of both self defense trained and untrained women
        towards their self-protection.

        ETHICAL CONSIDERATION:
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        The study was conducted after taking the appointment from the head of
        the organizations of selected sample. The researcher provided them
        institutional support letter and informed them about the objective and
        nature of the study to the respondents as well. It was assured that the
        participant’s privacy must be maintained. Written informed consent was
        obtained from all the participants. The study was approved by research
        committee at Fatima Jinnah Women University, The Mall, Rawalpindi.
        Plagiarism was also checked by the quality enhancement cell (QEC) of the
        university.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 font-semibold text-[18px] mb-[-10px] ">DISCUSSION</p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Data was collected from 60 untrained and 60 trained women. 25.8 percent
        of women were less than 20 years old where as 47.5 percent in between 21
        to 23 and 26.7 percent of the women were above 24. 54.2 percent women
        were residing in Rawalpindi whereas remining in Islamabad. 10 percent of
        women were have qualification under SSC level and 47.5 percent were
        having 11 to 14 years of education whereas 42.5 percent were highly
        qualified. Level of training shows that 50 percent were untrained but in
        remaining 50 percent, 14.2 percent were Yellow belt and 35.8 percent of
        trained women were having orange belt (Table 1). To meet first objective
        data was analyzed through statistical techniques. Mann-Whitney technique
        of non-parametric tests was used to compare the perception of self
        defense trained and untrained group of women. Here group 1 is of
        untrained women and group 2 comprises trained women. Results of
        comparison in different components are given in Table 1. The result of
        this study are supported by the study of Hollander (2016). Table 2 shows
        that SDT empowers women that leads to differences in perception of self
        defense trained and untrained women. 0.039 is less than critical value
        0.05 which shows that SDT reduces the fear of being assaulted. 0.005
        tells that never trusting anyone is the main rule of safety. 0.841 shows
        that SDT improves assertiveness, aggressiveness, cognitive, physical and
        verbal skills in trained women. 0.012 rejects the hypothesis that SDT
        women do not feel safer to go out in public places, but those women feel
        safer than untrained women to face public. To meet second objective,
        descriptive analysis is used. The results of the study are related to
        the findings of William and Hebl study in 2005. Certain most relevant
        questions were asked from both trained and untrained women to depict
        strategies of self defense. Results in table 3 show that 66.7 percent of
        the respondents cumulatively agree on never trust others to secure
        yourself. To self protection, 85 percent of women collectively agree to
        give importance to ourselves. 60 percent of respondents are aware of
        self protection in dangerous environment. Whereas, 75 percent of women
        are aware of what happening around them. 68.3 percent of women know
        about use of drugs in gathering that can be cause of danger and 1.7
        percent of women disagree on the danger in gathering caused by use of
        drugs. So through these components, strategies of self protection in
        different environment can be shown supported by Brecklin and Ullman
        (1999).
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 font-semibold text-[18px] mb-[-10px] ">Conclusion</p>
      <p className="my-4">
        The focus of the study was to audit the perception of self-defense
        trained and untrained girls towards their self-protection and comprise
        the strategies that both groups has used for their self-protection.
        There are numerous articles published on the matter of women
        self-defense training and the problems that they confront along the way
        at the global level. This proves that actively participating in
        self-defense classes for women is a challenge across the globe. however
        the causes may vary like some women learn self-defense training before
        their assault experience and some were learned after their
        victimization. The study found that it is the socio-cultural norms and
        the stereotypical gender roles assigned to women, which create barrier
        their tectonic and active participation in self-defense classes. Women
        who had the self-defense training are less likely to become a victim of
        assault than average women. Self-defense trained women use appropriate
        strategies for their self-protection when required in order to reduce
        the chances of being victimized. Analysis denotes that there is
        insignificant relationship exists between self-defense trained and
        untrained girls about attitude for self-protection. Both groups coincide
        that to avoid is the best attitude of self-protection. Self-defense
        training teaches women different skills and improve their physical and
        verbal skills and self-defense trained women feel safer than average
        women those do not have self-defense training in public places.
        Untrained women contemplate that self-defense training implies victim
        blaming if self-defense trained women failed to protect themselves from
        violence and then in consequence everyone will blame her for assault.
        While self-defense trained women do not concur with them. Self-defense
        training gives freedom to move freely in public domain. Therefore, it is
        necessary that women learn self-defense training because findings
        manifest that girls with self-defense training are better able to tackle
        with assault situations and more likely to reduce the risk of violence
        and confident to talk with stranger than women which do not have
        training. Cite as: Faiza Parveen, ADEELA REHMAN, Dr. Naimatullah Hashmi,
