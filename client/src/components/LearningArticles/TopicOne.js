        Gender equality is a human right, but our world faces a persistent gap
        in access to opportunities and decision-making power for women and men.
      </h1>
      <p className="my-4">
        Globally, women have fewer opportunities for economic participation than
        men, less access to basic and higher education, greater health and
        safety risks, and less political representation. Guaranteeing the rights
        of women and giving them opportunities to reach their full potential is
        critical not only for attaining gender equality, but also for meeting a
        wide range of international development goals. Empowered women and girls
        contribute to the health and productivity of their families,
        communities, and countries, creating a ripple effect that benefits
        everyone. The word gender describes the socially-constructed roles and
        responsibilities that societies consider appropriate for men and women.
        Gender equality means that men and women have equal power and equal
        opportunities for financial independence, education, and personal
        development. Women's empowerment is a critical aspect of achieving
        gender equality. It includes increasing a woman's sense of self-worth,
        her decision-making power, her access to opportunities and resources,
        her power and control over her own life inside and outside the home, and
        her ability to effect change. Yet gender issues are not focused on women
        alone, but on the relationship between men and women in society. The
        actions and attitudes of men and boys play an essential role in
        achieving gender equality.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Education is a key area of focus. Although the world is making progress
        in achieving gender parity in education, girls still make up a higher
        percentage of out-of-school children than boys. Approximately one
        quarter of girls in the developing world do not attend school.
        Typically, families with limited means who cannot afford costs such as
        school fees, uniforms, and supplies for all of their children will
        prioritize education for their sons. Families may also rely on girls'
        labor for household chores, carrying water, and childcare, leaving
        limited time for schooling. But prioritizing girls' education provides
        perhaps the single highest return on investment in the developing world.
        An educated girl is more likely to postpone marriage, raise a smaller
        family, have healthier children, and send her own children to school.
        She has more opportunities to earn an income and to participate in
        political processes, and she is less likely to become infected with HIV.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Women's health and safety is another important area. HIV/AIDS is
        becoming an increasingly impactful issue for women. This can be related
        to women having fewer opportunities for health education, unequal power
        in sexual partnership, or as a result of gender-based violence. Maternal
        health is also an issue of specific concern. In many countries, women
        have limited access to prenatal and infant care, and are more likely to
        experience complications during pregnancy and childbirth. This is a
        critical concern in countries where girls marry and have children before
        they are ready; often well before the age of 18. Quality maternal health
        care can provide an important entry point for information and services
        that empower mothers as informed decision-makers concerning their own
        health and the health of their children.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        A final area of focus in attaining gender equality is women's economic
        and political empowerment. Though women comprise more than 50% of the
        world's population, they only own 1% of the world's wealth. Throughout
        the world, women and girls perform long hours of unpaid domestic work.
        In some places, women still lack rights to own land or to inherit
        property, obtain access to credit, earn income, or to move up in their
        workplace, free from job discrimination. At all levels, including at
        home and in the public arena, women are widely underrepresented as
        decision-makers. In legislatures around the world, women are outnumbered
        4 to 1, yet women's political participation is crucial for achieving
        gender equality and genuine democracy.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        The World Economic Forum recently ranked the United States as 19th in
        the world on its gender gap index. With women comprising less than one
        fifth of elected members of Congress, the report identifies political
        empowerment as the greatest gender equity issue for the United States.
        The U.S. ranked higher in economic empowerment, but women's earning
        power remains approximately 20% lower than men's. Women in the United
        States have a very high ranking of educational attainment, though, with
        high levels of literacy and enrollment in primary, secondary, and
        university education. At present, there are more U.S. women attending
        college than men. Globally, no country has fully attained gender
        equality. Scandinavian countries like Iceland, Norway, Finland, and
        Sweden lead the world in their progress toward closing the gender gap.
        In these countries, there is relatively equitable distribution of
        available income, resources, and opportunities for men and women. The
        greatest gender gaps are identified primarily in the Middle East,
        Africa, and South Asia. However, a number of countries in these regions,
        including Lesotho, South Africa, and Sri Lanka outrank the United States
        in gender equality.

        Around the world, Peace Corps Volunteers are working with communities to
        address gender equality and empower women and girls. In 1974, Congress
        signed the Percy Amendment requiring Peace Corps Volunteers to actively
        integrate women into the economic, political, and social development of
        their countries. Many Peace Corps Volunteers implement the Camp GLOW
        program, or Girls Leading Our World, to help girls develop self-esteem
        and leadership skills. Recognizing that men and boys must be equal
        partners in achieving gender equality, Volunteers also teach leadership
        and life skills to boys through Teaching Our Boys Excellence (TOBE)
        camps. Peace Corps Volunteers promote gender equality and women's
        empowerment through health education, business development, and by
        raising awareness of women's rights and contributions to their
        communities. Learn more about how Peace Corps Volunteers are working
        with communities by visiting the Paul D. Coverdell World Wise Schools
